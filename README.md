#Quick Stock Summary GUI

##Description
This is a simple GUI that accepts a stock ticker symbol and returns a summary.  The summary is what I wanted to see at a quick glance in one location, and isn't what is easily found.  It also has the option to open a webpage or make a graph.  It's written in Python 3.  It appears a little slow, but it has to obtain a lot of data from the internet and then do a lot of calculations.  Please be patient and give it 5-10 seconds.

##Installation
Working on this, I'm newer to programming and don't know what I'm doing.

##Support
This is probably a one hit wonder and there will be no support.
Heavily dependent on yfinance, so if that breaks, this will as well.

##Roadmap
None.  Possibly make prettier, or add features if I have time.

this wouldn't be possible.

##Project Status
Static.  Unlikely I will be able to maintain or improve.  Do what you want with
it.  However, it doesn't hurt to ask me to update or improve a feature.
